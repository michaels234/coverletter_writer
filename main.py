10. if a job entails anything related to math or physics or machines, make sure to highlight my strength in those thanks to my background on mathematics, physics, and mechanical engineering.

accenture_projects = """1. I did full-stack development for multiple in-store web apps and mobile apps for a cosmetics company. The app is for users in the store to browse cosmetics products, as well as virtually put cosmetics on their face with a camera display that uses facial recognition to apply makeup on their face like a filter. I led small sub-teams on this project, owning features from start to finish. We used an external company for the AI makeup camera and implemented it into our app. The stack was python run in aws lambda, mysql, with api gateway and rds among other aws services, javascript, typescript, html, css frontend with reactive javascript frameworks, particularly vue.js. mobile was android, java, kotlin. This project is the one I mentioned in my resume "Increased avg. user spending by $200/yr".
2. I did development on Android TV system settings apps for an electronics company. The stack was android, java, kotlin, sqlite. i had to lead overseas teams on this project in 2 languages (japanese and English). This project is the one I mentioned in my resume as "Completed 6mo of work in 4 on distressed project.".
3. I developed an android app from scratch, using a generative AI api we paid for that takes an image and text as input and uses image recognition and generative ai to understand the image and the input text which is usually a question about the image, and then it uses generative ai to output an answer, thats all the api we paid for, but i implemented that api into an android app for use by blind people so they can get information about their surroundings. they can ask a question and get information about what the camera sees. it was an android wearable device with a camera speaker and mic. it spoke the answers aloud. Android, kotlin ,java. This project is the one I mentioned in my resume as "Inspired 6-figure project contract".
4. I worked full-stack on an iot system that has a front and backend, its for a tire manufacturer for use in the factory, the system uses receivers around the factory and transmitters on mobile equipment, and using those iot signals the app estimates equipment location so factory workers don't have to look for equipment as much. This one increased factory efficiency for this process. Python AWS rds dynamodb lambda event bridge batch iot JavaScript vue.js reactive framework. We used AI for taking signals and outputting estimated location. We trained with tensorflow. This project is the one I mentioned in my resume as "Improved efficiency of one factory process by 75%".
5. I created a whole app myself for use on a farm that employs disabled employees for disabled community outreach. The app helps managers on the farm check seeds planted by using image recognition to see if the seeds are planted too deep or too shallow. It decreased time managers had to check the workers tasks. Python flask JavaScript vue.js opencv and we used sagemaker to train the ai. This project is the one I mentioned in my resume as "Reduced time managers spent checking workersâ€™ tasks by 65%"."""
